This project demonstrates the concept
of lazy loading components in a React
application. Lazy loading allows you
to load components only when they
are needed, improving the initial
loading time of your application.

Step 1: Project Setup

-  Set up a new React project using
a tool like Create React App or
your preferred method.
-  Ensure that you have Node.js
and npm installed on your machine.

Step 2: Identify Components

-  Identify two or more components 
in your project that can benefit
from lazy loading.
-  These components should be relatively
large or have heavy dependencies.

Step 3: Create Placeholder Components

-  Create placeholder components for
each of the components identified
in the previous step.
-  Placeholder components can be simple
functional components that display
a loading indicator or a message.

Step 4: Implement Lazy Loading

-  Use the React.lazy function to implement
lazy loading for each of the components.
-  Wrap the import statements for
each component with React.lazy

Step 5: Render Lazy Components

-  In your main app component, render
the lazy components using the
Suspense component from React.
-  Wrap the rendering of each component
inside a <Suspense> component and
provide a fallback prop that renders
the placeholder component:
  
Step 6: Test and Verify

-  Start your React development server
and open the application in your browser.
-  Verify that the components load
asynchronously and display the
expected content.
-  Observe the placeholder components
while the lazy components are being loaded.

Step 7: Further Exploration

-  Experiment with adding more components
and lazy-loading them using React.lazy.
-  Test the performance improvements
gained from lazy loading.
-  Explore other features of React.lazy,
such as error boundaries and the maxDuration option.
